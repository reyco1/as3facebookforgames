The Facebook For Games Library is an extension of the Facebook Actionscript API (packaged within the library as some changes needed to be made) which facilitates the process of authenticating and user log-in within your Facebook web games. It takes care of all the grunt work of logging in the user, if they are not logged in already, and then having the user authenticate your game ( all pretty much a single, swift process. )

Once your game is authenticated, you now have access to the game’s and user’s scores. The library also makes it extremely easy to save the score to Facebook and to share or post it to the user’s wall.
